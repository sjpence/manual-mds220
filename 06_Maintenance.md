# PREVENTATIVE MAINTENANCE

We intentionally have not dedicated an entire chapter to maintenance. As you will see, there is very little maintenance required on the **UNIT**DESIGN machines. The maintenance that is required is very simple to perform.

## Rails

Since the carriage is self-propelled (via a drive wheel system), dried flux, solder and other materials on the rails could restrict the carriage from free travel. We recommend a daily rail cleaning with alcohol or a citrus based cleaner. Water soluble fluxes tend to be quite corrosive to sheet metal parts, therefore care should be taken to clean up spills and splatters.

## Flux Tank Cover

Before replacing the flux tank cover at the end of a shift, make sure that the tank edge and matching cover edge are both clean. Most fluxes are quite sticky and putting the cover on a dirty tank could cause problems when attempting to remove the cover later.

## Drip Pans

A lining of aluminum foil inside of the drip pans will make cleaning them much easier.

## Water Trap

Before each use, be sure to empty the water trap located below the flux system and air-knife pressure regulators. Simply twist the valve underneath the bowl counterclockwise to empty the water trap.
