# INTRODUCTION

Thank you for choosing one of **UNIT**DESIGN’s MDS Series Soldering Systems.

**UNIT**DESIGN prides itself on designing and manufacturing machines that are simple to operate and maintain. Our soldering and tinning machines are good examples of this corporate emphasis, but a full working knowledge of these machines is necessary for accurate set up, operation and maintenance. This manual contains that information. Please read it thoroughly before attempting to set up your new machine.

PLEASE ALLOW ONLY A QUALIFIED ELECTRICIAN TO CONNECT THE HIGH VOLTAGE WIRING TO THE MACHINE.

If you have any questions, please contact our service department at (714) 672-9944, or by email at <service@unitdesign.com>.

## DESCRIPTION OF MDS SERIES MACHINES

The MDS soldering machines consist of 3 main modules:

- Power Module
- Carriage Module
- Control Module

In addition to these modules, the machines consist of 3 other major parts:

- Solder Pot
- Preheater
- Carrier

Finally each machine contains a fluxing system:

- Foam Fluxer (MDS-200)
- Spray Fluxer (MDS-220)

All of these modules/major parts are attached to the chromed steel rails or the powder-coated steel frame and perform individual, specific functions within the soldering machine.

The balance of this chapter is dedicated to descriptions of the main modules and major parts of the **UNIT**DESIGN Soldering and Tinning Machines.

## POWER MODULE

The Power Module is located behind a sheet metal panel at the left end of the machine. It houses most of the machine’s high voltage components such as relays, fuses, drivers, etc.

![Power Module](./media/mds_power.jpg){ width=4.25in }

The power module in the above picture is from an MDS-220. The power modules for the other **UNIT**DESIGN soldering and tinning machines have some components in different locations. Component drawings for specific machines are included as an attachment.

The machine’s main power switch is located on the sheet metal panel which covers the power module. The power module cover panel can only be removed when the main power switch is in the OFF position. The main power switch can be padlocked, which allows for the lockout of the machine while maintenance is being performed.

Outside power is connected to the machine at the electrical box located at the rear of the machine, on the back panel closest to the carrier load position.

See the attachments for the wiring schematics.

## CARRIAGE MODULE

The carriage module is the only moving part on the **UNIT**DESIGN soldering and tinning machines. The carriage travels back and forth on the chassis rails, transporting the PCB’s through the various stages of fluxing, preheating, and soldering or tinning. The carriage connects to the machine via a retract cable assembly which plugs into the rear of the carriage.

## CONTROL MODULE

The control module consists of a touchscreen in an enclosure mounted to the front of the frame. All programming and machine operation functions are performed utilizing the touchscreen operator interface.

The control module allows the operator to set, monitor and control the following parameters:

- Solder Temperature
- Preheat Temperature
- Preheat Time
- etc.

## SOLDER POT

The 150 lbs. capacity solder pot is sealed cast iron.

Bolted below the solder pot is a one-piece aluminum cast heater specifically designed for this solder pot.

When the solder pot is empty, the thermocouple well is exposed. It is parallel to the carriage’s line of travel and about 3/4" below the surface. Exercise caution when placing solder bars in the solder pot, so as not to crack or damage the thermocouple or thermocouple well.

The electrical box mounted below the solder pot contains the high voltage wires to the heater block. The automatic mechanical thermal limit switch is mounted in the electrical box along the gutter at the rear of the machine. This switch protects the solder pot from overheating in the event of an electrical malfunction. The setting on this switch is preset by the factory and SHOULD NOT BE ADJUSTED.

## PREHEATER

**UNIT**DESIGN provides a radiant panel preheater in all of its MDS-200 Series Soldering Machines and its ALT-200 Tinning Machines.

The preheating stage serves many functions during the soldering process. First, it prepares the flux by evaporating the volatiles and bringing it to its activation temperature. Next, by preheating the PCB before soldering we reduce the temperature difference between the board and the solder, and therefore diminish the potential for thermal shock of components and warpage of the board. Finally, by preheating the PCB we reduce the amount of heat needed during the soldering step to bring the solder joints to the wetting temperature. This allows for shorter dwell times in the solder and therefore quicker cycles.

## CARRIER

In order for the carriage module to transport the Printed Circuit Boards (PCBs) through the soldering process, the PCBs are placed in the carrier. The carrier bars, which mount in the carrier, come equipped with titanium fingers. These fingers hold the two opposing sides of the PCB.

The carrier is set on top of the cams found in the carriage module, and therefore can be easily lifted out for quick loading and unloading of the PCBs. Each MDS Soldering Machine or ALT Tinning Machine comes factory equipped with two carriers. Additional carriers may be purchased to allow for quick changeover between PCBs of differing sizes.

Extra dual-fingered center bars (MDS-100/CB) may be added to the carrier to allow for the soldering of additional rows of PCBs.

## FOAM FLUXER

The foam fluxer is manufactured from welded polypropylene and is compatible with any foaming flux used in electronic soldering. There is a major difference in the amount of compressed air required between high solids fluxes, such as rosin based and water soluble fluxes, and low solids fluxes, such as No-Clean Fluxes (NCFs). High solids fluxes require very little air pressure (5 to 10 psi) at moderate flow rates; compatible with a small oiless compressor. However NCFs require higher pressure and flow, making it more practical to use filtered and dried normal 90-120 psi shop air.

The flux tank is in three parts. The actual fluxing funnel loosely stands on the bottom of the flux tank within raised plastic corners. Inside the bottom of the funnel is the airstone, which is a 60 micron polyethylene tube plugged at one end. Compressed air is fed to the one end through a tubing. The airstone itself can be easily fouled by handling (human body oils) or by not using clean dry compressed air. They are difficult to clean and usually require replacement when fouled.

![Foam Fluxer](./media/mds-foam-flux.jpg){ width=4.25in }

The last part of the flux tank is the cover. The cover cannot be installed until the carriage has been carefully pushed forward beyond the flux tank. To do this, lift the back of the carriage a few inches, and push it towards the solder pot.

When not operating, we recommend putting the cover onto the tank to avoid losing flux solvents (thinners) to evaporation, and to prevent accidental flux contamination from outside sources.
The evaporation rate of the flux thinner, typically isopropyl alcohol, is directly proportional to the amount of time that the foam fluxer is operated. To minimize evaporation of the alcohol and reduce volatile organic compound (VOC) emissions, a VOC fluxer delay is programmed so that compressed air can be turned on and off when needed during the cycle.

When the START button is pushed, a solenoid opens, allowing air to flow into the airstone. After the programmed flux delay allows the foam head to stabilize, the carriage starts its travel. When the carriage stops at the preheat position, the solenoid closes to stop the foaming action.

## SPRAY FLUXER

The spray fluxer is split into two sections. The upper section is mounted to the machine frame between the rails that the carriage runs on. This section contains the atomizing spray nozzle as well as the actuator that cycles the nozzle under the boards in the carrier.

The flux tank control section is mounted behind the doors in the lower portion of the machine frame. This section consists of the flux and thinner tanks, as well as the air pressure control regulators. There is one regulator to control the pressure of each tank and a third regulator to control the atomizing air pressure. A selector valve allows either flux or thinner to be directed to the spray nozzle.
