# INTRODUCTION

Thank you for choosing one of **UNIT**DESIGN’s MDS-Series Soldering Systems or ALT-Series Lead Tinning Systems.

**UNIT**DESIGN prides itself on designing and manufacturing machines that are simple to operate and maintain. Our soldering and tinning machines are good examples of this corporate emphasis, but a full working knowledge of these machines is necessary for accurate set up, operation and maintenance. This manual contains that information. Please read it thoroughly before attempting to set up your new machine.

PLEASE ALLOW ONLY A QUALIFIED ELECTRICIAN TO CONNECT THE HIGH VOLTAGE WIRING TO THE MACHINE.

If you have any questions, please contact our service department at (714) 672-9944, or by email at <service@unitdesign.com>.

## DESCRIPTION OF MDS AND ALT SERIES MACHINES

The MDS-100/200 soldering machines consist of 3 main modules:

- Power Module
- Carriage Module
- Control Module

In addition to these modules, the machines consist of 5 other major parts:

- Foam Fluxer
- Air Knife
- Solder Pot
- Preheater (200 Series)
- Carrier

All of these modules/major parts are attached to the chromed steel rails or the powder-coated steel frame and perform individual, specific functions within the soldering machine.

The MDS-210 long lead soldering machine and the ALT-100/200 tinning machines are slightly different in the make-up of their main modules. These machines utilize a recirculating flux system instead of a foam fluxer. There is also different software installed in the Programmable Logic Controller (PLC), located within the power module, which changes the carriage cam action for raising and lowering the carrier. These machines also have longer cams for more vertical movement.

The MDS-210T has an additional software package installed which allows it to utilize both the soldering process of an MDS-210 and the tinning process of an ALT-200.

The balance of this chapter is dedicated to descriptions of the main modules and major parts of the **UNIT**DESIGN Soldering and Tinning Machines.

## POWER MODULE

The Power Module is located behind a sheet metal panel at the left end of the machine. It houses most of the machine’s high voltage components such as relays, fuses, drivers, etc.

The power module in the above picture is from an MDS-200. The power modules for the other **UNIT**DESIGN soldering and tinning machines have some components in different locations. Component drawings for all of the power modules are contained in Appendix C.

The machine’s main power switch is located on the sheet metal panel which covers the power module. The power module cover panel can only be removed when the main power switch is in the OFF position. The main power switch can be padlocked, which allows for the lockout of the machine while maintenance is being performed.

Outside power is connected to the machine at the electrical box located at the rear of the machine, on the back panel closest to the carrier load position.

See Appendix C for power module wiring diagram.

## CARRIAGE MODULE

The carriage module is the only moving part on the **UNIT**DESIGN soldering and tinning machines. The carriage travels back and forth on the chassis rails, transporting the PCB’s through the various stages of fluxing, preheating, and soldering or tinning. The carriage connects to the machine via a retract cable assembly which plugs into the rear of the carriage.

## CONTROL MODULE

The control module consists of a touchscreen mounted on a stainless steel arm, located to the left of the carriage load position. All programming and machine operation functions are performed utilizing the touchscreen operator interface.

The control module allows the operator to set, monitor and control the following parameters:

- Solder Temperature
- Preheat Temperature
- Preheat Time
- etc.

## SOLDER POT

The 150 lbs. capacity solder pot is sealed cast iron.

Bolted below the solder pot is a one-piece aluminum cast heater specifically designed for this solder pot.

When the solder pot is empty, the thermocouple well is exposed. It is parallel to the carriage’s line of travel and about 3/4" below the surface. Exercise caution when placing solder bars in the solder pot, so as not to crack or damage the thermocouple or thermocouple well.

The electrical box mounted below the solder pot contains the high voltage wires to the heater block. The automatic mechanical thermal limit switch is mounted in the electrical box along the gutter at the rear of the machine. This switch protects the solder pot from overheating in the event of an electrical malfunction. The setting on this switch is preset by the factory and SHOULD NOT BE ADJUSTED.

## FOAM FLUXER

The foam fluxer is manufactured from welded polypropylene and is compatible with any foaming flux used in electronic soldering. There is a major difference in the amount of compressed air required between high solids fluxes, such as rosin based and water soluble fluxes, and low solids fluxes, such as No-Clean Fluxes (NCFs). High solids fluxes require very little air pressure (5 to 10 psi) at moderate flow rates; compatible with a small oiless compressor. However NCFs require higher pressure and flow, making it more practical to use filtered and dried normal 90-120 psi shop air.

The flux tank is in three parts. The actual fluxing funnel loosely stands on the bottom of the flux tank within raised plastic corners. Inside the bottom of the funnel is the porus 15" long, 1 ½" diameter airstone, which is a 60 micron polyethylene tube plugged at one end. Compressed air is fed to the front end through a clear poly tubing. The airstone itself can be easily fouled by handling (human body oils) or by not using clean dry compressed air. They are difficult to clean and usually require replacement when fouled.

The last part of the flux tank is the cover. The cover cannot be installed until the carriage has been carefully pushed forward beyond the flux tank. To do this, lift the back of the carriage a few inches, and push it towards the solder pot.

When not operating, we recommend putting the cover onto the tank to avoid losing flux solvents (thinners) to evaporation, and to prevent accidental flux contamination from outside sources.

The evaporation rate of the flux thinner, typically isopropyl alcohol, is directly proportional to the amount of time that the foam fluxer is operated. To minimize evaporation of the alcohol and reduce volatile organic compound (VOC) emissions, a VOC fluxer delay is programmed so that compressed air can be turned on and off when needed during the cycle.

When the START button is pushed, a solenoid opens, allowing air to flow into the airstone. After the programmed flux delay allows the foam head to stabilize, the carriage starts its travel. When the carriage stops at the preheat position, the solenoid closes to stop the foaming action.

The amount of time required for the foam head to stabilize varies for different types of flux, and also depends on the liquid level in the flux tank. Therefore, the flux delay time is a programmable parameter that is set in each individual recipe. This allows for the lowest possible cycle times while still maintaining maximum flexibility.

Typically when using no-clean fluxes, the VOC fluxer delay is set between 5 and 10 seconds. When using rosin based or water soluble fluxes, the delay is typically 5 seconds or less.

An ON button and an OFF button which function to override the VOC fluxer delay are located on the operator interface’s Main Menu screen. This allows the foam fluxer to be turned on without running the carriage. Therefore, the air pressure can be adjusted in order to change the foam head height.

In order to control the amount of flux applied to the boards, the speed that the carriage travels over the foam fluxer can be adjusted. The flux speed is a fully adjustable parameter which is stored in each recipe, allowing for flexibility in the area of flux application.

## CARRIER

In order for the carriage module to transport the Printed Circuit Boards (PCBs) through the soldering process, the PCBs are placed in the carrier. The carrier bars, which mount in the carrier, come equipped with titanium fingers. These fingers hold the two opposing sides of the PCB.

The carrier is set on top of the cams found in the carriage module, and therefore can be easily lifted out for quick loading and unloading of the PCBs. Each MDS Soldering Machine or ALT Tinning Machine comes factory equipped with two carriers. Additional carriers may be purchased to allow for quick changeover between PCBs of differing sizes.

Extra dual-fingered center bars (MDS-100/CB) may be added to the carrier to allow for the soldering of additional rows of PCBs.

The MDS-100/200 Soldering Machine carriers are equipped with a vertical lip extension on the forward carrier support surface. This is the front of the carrier, and it sits atop the forward pair (closest to the solder pot) of cams on the carriage module. The rear support surface of the carrier rests on the rear pair of cams.

The MDS-210 Soldering Machine and the ALT-100/200 Tinning Machine carriers lack the vertical lip extension on the forward support surface. Therefore the carrier is symmetrical and doesn’t need to placed in the carriage in a specific orientation. The carriers are equipped with leveling pads which rest atop of the cams. These pads allow for the precise leveling of the carrier to provide the most accurate tinning or soldering.

## PREHEATER

**UNIT**DESIGN provides a dual zone, radiant panel preheater in its MDS-200/210 Soldering Machines and its ALT-200 Tinning Machines.

The preheating stage serves many functions during the soldering process. First, it prepares the flux by evaporating the volatiles and bringing it to its activation temperature. Next, by preheating the PCB before soldering we reduce the temperature difference between the board and the solder, and therefore diminish the potential for thermal shock of components and warpage of the board. Finally, by preheating the PCB we reduce the amount of heat needed during the soldering step to bring the solder joints to the wetting temperature. This allows for shorter dwell times in the solder and therefore quicker cycles.

## HIGH PRESSURE AIR KNIFE

The air knife assembly consists of an EXAIR^®^ brand air knife, solenoid and a filter/regulator. The EXAIR^®^-Knife is an amplification style air knife which use the coanda effect (wall attachment of a high velocity fluid) to create a high volume airflow from a small amount of compressed air. The airflow is activated by the solenoid when the carriage travels across the air knife. The velocity and flow of the EXAIR^®^-Knife can be adjusted through the use of the pressure regulator.

The purpose of the air knife in the soldering process is to remove excess flux applied during the fluxing stage, to break any foam bubbles, and to spread the flux around the bottom of the PCBs. Most importantly, the air knife blows flux up through the holes in the board. This is critical to promote wetting of the solder joints in order to form good solder fillets on the top of the board.
