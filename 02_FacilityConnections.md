## SUPPORT REQUIREMENTS

Listed below are specifications and support requirements for the **UNIT**DESIGN soldering and tinning machines.

### Electrical:

- 100 Series: 208-240 VAC, 1 Phase, 23 Amps
- 200 Series: 208-240 VAC, 1 Phase, 45 Amps

(All machines require three-wire hard connection (2-Hot))

### Compressed Air:

- MDS-100/200/210: 40 CFM
- MDS-220: 5 CFM
- ALT-100/200: 40 CFM (with optional air-knife)

Filtered and dried, 90-120 psi, intermittent during cycle)

## VENTILATION

A 500 CFM ducted fan is suggested as the minimum for the MDS-100 and is advised for all other units. A fume hood over the entire machine makes a nice installation. Many water-soluble (OA) fluxes smoke excessively and a minimum of 1,200 CFM is recommended for these applications.

The MDS-220 includes an extra ventilation port to assist in containing any over-spray from the fluxer nozzle.

## SUGGESTED MACHINE PLACEMENT

Since maintenance and service of the **UNIT**DESIGN soldering and tinning machines can be performed from the front of the machine, very little clearance is needed on the solder pot end and rear of the machine. However, for ease of installation and connection of electrical and compressed air services at least 1 foot of clearance should be allowed at the rear of the machine. A minimum of 2 feet should be allowed at the load end of the machine to provide easy access to the power module. Three to four feet in front of the machine should be an adequate operator working space.
