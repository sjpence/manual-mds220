# INSTALLATION

The **UNIT**DESIGN soldering and tinning machines are designed to be easily set up. The following installation instructions will allow you to prepare the machine for actual start-up. Do not attempt to run the machine without first following these steps:

1. Remove all packaging material. Cut all metal and plastic straps. Remove padding from the hood supports. Remove operating accessories from the flux tank. DO NOT ATTEMPT TO ROLL THE CARRIAGE.

1. The control module is shipped uninstalled to protect it from damage during shipping. Remove the control module from its cardboard box, located on top of the flux tank. Slip the collar on the back of the module over the end of the stainless steel arm and tighten set screw. The power and communication cables are already plugged into the power module so no electrical connections need to be made.

1. Level machine. First run up the two center frame leveling pads. Using a carpenter’s level placed on the powder-coated frame, adjust the four outer leveling pads using a wrench. Level the frame in both axes, left to right and front to back. Once the frame is level, lower the center pads to provide additional machine support.

1. Confirm that the chrome rails are level. Using a carpenter’s level placed on the chrome rails, check both axes of the rails. The rails are leveled to the frame at the factory but the studs may have loosened during shipment. The rail mounting studs can be accessed through the double doors on the front of the machine. You will need to remove the solder pot guard to access the mounting studs at the solder pot end of the machine. Before adjustment, be sure to loosen the nut below the mounting bracket which locks the stud position. If necessary adjust the rail mounting studs using a wrench. Once the rails are level, tighten the lower nut to lock rails in position.

1. Make sure the solder pot is resting on its 4 adjustment bolts. There have been instances where the pot has shifted during shipment due to rough handling.

1. Install Foam Flux Tank (MDS-100/200). Lift flux tank and remove the drip pans out the front of the machine. Place one pan each under the flux tank, the preheater, and the solder pot. To gain access to the area under the solder pot and preheater you will need to remove the stainless steel solder pot guard found behind the right set of double doors. Be sure the flux tank is placed horizontally against the chrome crossbar in front of the air knife assembly. The flux tank air hose should be facing toward the control module end of the machine. Connect the end of the air hose to the bulkhead fitting, found on the stainless panel that the flux tanks rests on, by simultaneously depressing the red collar while inserting the air hose. Pull on the air hose slightly to ensure a proper grip. (To remove air hose, press red collar while pulling hose.)

1. Connect Power. All electrical connections should be made by a qualified electrician. The main power connections are made in an electrical box located on the rear panel at the loading end of the machine. Refer to the Support Requirements (section 2.0) of the manual for voltage requirements.

**CAUTION:**

**ALWAYS SHUT OFF MAIN POWER BREAKER AT SOURCE BEFORE REMOVING ELECTRICAL BOX COVER!**
