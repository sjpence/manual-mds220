# SERVICE PROCEDURES

## CARRIAGE MODULE REPLACEMENT

1. Turn machine off.

1. Disconnect the larger motor retract cable and the smaller optics retract cable by pressing on the center release lever of the connectors.

1. Remove the retract chain mounting screws.

1. Lift carriage module from rails.

1. Place upside-down on a flat surface. (This protects the magnetic sensor on the underside of the carriage.)

1. To replace, reverse procedure.

## SKIMMER BLADE REPLACEMENT

1. Push skimmer blade toward the back of the machine, compressing the spring until other end can be removed.

1. To install new skimmer reverse the procedure in step one. (Make sure the bottom of the blade is facing the solder pot.)

## “NYROD” REPLACEMENT

1. Remove both carriage covers.

1. Remove carriage from machine and place it upside down on a bench.

1. Locate the four “nyrod” stubs.

1. Center punch the four stubs. Using a \#38 (or similar) drill bit, drill into the stub. Be careful not to drill into the aluminum plate! The “nyrod” stub should come out when the drill bit is removed. Some remaining pieces of the stub may need to be cleaned out with an X-acto blade or tweezers.

1. Use a pair of pliers to start the “nyrod” into the hole. By twisting and pushing, you should be able to force the rod all the way into the hole until it seats. If it is loose, you may need to use a drop of glue to keep it in place.

1. Cut the rod, leaving about 1/16" protruding from the plate.

1. Install the carriage back of the machine. (Leave the covers off.)

1. Turn the machine on and allow it to come to normal operating temperature. This lets all parts expand slightly, allowing for a more accurate adjustment.

1. Trim al four “nyrods” with a razor knife or file so that the carriage is able to sit down in its normal position between the frame rails. Cycle the carriage several times using at least a 30 sec preheat time. Make visual checks to see if the carriage is “binding-up” anywhere. Make any final trimming adjustments necessary.

## HEATER BLOCK REPLACEMENT

1. Turn machine off.

1. Remove panel front panel covering solder pot end of the machine. (Open doors if machine is so equipped.) Remove stainless steel solder pot guard. Remove stainless steel drip pan by lifting and pulling it out. This will give clear access to the heater block and solder pot.

1. Remove aluminum guard box and disconnect the wires from the heater.

1. Remove all remaining screws. (Note: the block weighs about 25 lbs. so you might want to have another person assist you in lowering it.)

1. The underneath surface of the solder pot might be covered with a dark grayish powder. This can be cleaned off with isopropyl alcohol or acetone and paper towels.

1. Inspect the bolt holes in the pot. If necessary they may be cleaned out with a 1/4-20 tap.

1. You will need to acquire some type of anti-seize compound. Most industrial hardware stores carry some. (i.e. Bostik brand “Never-Seez”, Permatex brand “Anti-Seize Lubricant.”)

1. Apply a small amount of this compound to each stud screw (provided) and insert them into solder pot.

1. Coat the entire mounting surface of block with compound. A paint brush, or preferably an ink roller, should be used to spread the compound to a uniform thickness of approx. .020 - 030".

1. Lift the block up onto the pot and install the washers and nuts (provided) to the studs.

1. When connecting the wires, make sure that the nut closest to the ceramic insulator is backed off enough to allow the insulator to move freely. (If the nut is too tight, the insulator will expand as it heats up and break.) When tightening other nut, hold nut closest to insulator with wrench. You will need two small 3/8" wrenches.

1. Re-install guard box.

1. Torque all nuts to 96 in-lb. Turn on machine and set temperature to 350°F. When temperature is reached, re-torque nuts to 96 in-lb.

## DRIVE WHEEL O-RING REPLACEMENT

1. Remove rear carriage cover.

1. Remove carriage from machine and place upside-down on bench.

1. Remove four (4) mounting screws attaching carriage drive motor from rear carriage plate.

1. Pull motor/drive axle/drive wheel assembly back until axle comes out of bushing on center plate.

1. Remove O-rings from drive wheel.

1. Install new O-rings and reverse procedure to re-install motor.

1. Re-install carriage on soldering machine. Run several cycles without carriage cover to verify smooth operation.

## HEATER AUTOTUNING

When a major change in heater (preheat or solder) set point is made (greater than 75°F) it may be necessary to re-tune the heaters to optimize their performance at the new set point. The Solder Pot Heater is tuned at the factory to 500°F and the Preheater to 650°F.

1. Change the recipe so the desired set point is displayed on the Main Menu screen.

1. Make sure the heater being tuned is turned on using the toggle switches on the Main Menu.

1. On the Main Menu, press the Settings button, then press Heaters along the left side to access the Autotuning Control screen.

1. Press the toggle switch for the heater you wish to tune. Only perform one autotuning function at a time. If you wish to tune both the Solder Heater and the Preheater, tune the Solder Pot Heater first, then tune the Preheater.

1. Once the toggle resets to off on the Autotuning Screen, the procedure is finished and the machine is ready for operation at the new set point.

The autotuning procedure can take 1 - 2 hours when tuning the Solder Pot Heater.
