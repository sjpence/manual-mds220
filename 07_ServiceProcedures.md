# SERVICE PROCEDURES

## CARRIAGE MODULE REPLACEMENT

1. Turn machine off.

1. Disconnect the three (3) motor retract cables and the optics retract cable by twisting on the center of the connectors. (The motor retract cables are color coded for ease of replacement.)

1. Remove the retract chain mounting screw.

1. Lift carriage module from rails.

1. Place upside-down on a flat surface. (This protects the magnetic sensor on the underside of the carriage.)

1. To replace, reverse procedure.

## AIRSTONE REPLACEMENT

1. Disconnect tube connecting bulkhead fitting (red collar) to the flux tank. This should be done to protect the regulator.

1. Disconnect airstone tube from fitting on inside wall of flux tank.

1. Holding the airstone tube and the foam funnel, lift and invert the funnel.

1. Lift tubing end of airstone about two inches above the funnel. Be careful not to bend/break the fitting.

1. Press the other end of the airstone out of the funnel.

1. To Replace, reverse procedure. Be sure not to touch the body of the airstone with your bare fingers, as body oil will clog the airstone’s pores.

## SKIMMER BLADE REPLACEMENT

1. Push skimmer blade toward the back of the machine, compressing the spring until other end can be removed.

1. To install new skimmer reverse the procedure in step one. (Make sure the bottom of the blade is facing the solder pot.)

## “NYROD” REPLACEMENT

1. Remove both carriage covers.

1. Remove carriage from machine and place it upside down on a bench.

1. Locate the four “nyrod” stubs.

1. Center punch the four stubs. Using a \#38 (or similar) drill bit, drill into the stub. Be careful not to drill into the aluminum plate! The “nyrod” stub should come out when the drill bit is removed. Some remaining pieces of the stub may need to be cleaned out with an X-acto blade or tweezers.

1. Use a pair of pliers to start the “nyrod” into the hole. By twisting and pushing, you shoul be able to force the rod all the way into the hole until it seats. If it is loose, you may need to use a drop of glue to keep it in place.

1. Cut the rod, leaving about 1/16" protruding from the plate.

1. Install the carriage back of the machine. (Leave the covers off.)

1. Turn the machine on and allow it to come to normal operating temperature. This lets all parts expand slightly, allowing for a more accurate adjustment.

1. Trim al four “nyrods” with a razor knife or file so that the carriage is able to sit down in its normal position between the frame rails. Cycle the carriage several times using at least a 30 sec preheat time. Make visual checks to see if the carriage is “binding-up” anywhere. Make any final trimming adjustments necessary.

## HEATER BLOCK REPLACEMENT

1. Turn machine off.

1. Remove panel front panel covering solder pot end of the machine. (Open doors if machine is so equipped.) Remove stainless steel solder pot guard. Remove stainless steel drip pan by lifting and pulling it out. This will give clear access to the heater block and solder pot.

1. Remove aluminum guard box and disconnect the wires from the heater.

1. Remove all remaining screws. (Note: the block weighs about 25 lbs. so you might want to have another person assist you in lowering it.)

1. The underneath surface of the solder pot might be covered with a dark grayish powder. This can be cleaned off with isopropyl alcohol or acetone and paper towels.

1. Inspect the bolt holes in the pot. If necessary they may be cleaned out with a 1/4-20 tap.

1. You will need to acquire some type of anti-seize compound. Most industrial hardware stores carry some. (i.e. Bostik brand “Never-Seez”, Permatex brand “Anti-Seize Lubricant.”)

1. Apply a small amount of this compound to each stud screw (provided) and insert them into solder pot.

1. Coat the entire mounting surface of block with compound. A paint brush, or preferably an ink roller, should be used to spread the compound to a uniform thickness of approx. .020 - 030".

1. Lift the block up onto the pot and install the washers and nuts (provided) to the studs.

1. When connecting the wires, make sure that the nut closest to the ceramic insulator is backed off enough to allow the insulator to move freely. (If the nut is too tight, the insulator will expand as it heats up and break.) When tightening other nut, hold nut closest to insulator with wrench. You will need two small 3/8" wrenches.

1. Re-install guard box.

1. Torque all nuts to 96 in-lb. Turn on machine and set temperature to 350°F. When temperature is reached, re-torque nuts to 96 in-lb.

## DRIVE WHEEL O-RING REPLACEMENT

1. Remove rear carriage cover.

1. Remove carriage from machine and place upside-down on bench.

1. Remove four (4) mounting screws attaching carriage drive motor from rear carriage plate.

1. Pull motor/drive axle/drive wheel assembly back until axle comes out of bushing on center plate.

1. Remove O-rings from drive wheel.

1. Install new O-rings and reverse procedure to re-install motor.

1. Re-install carriage on soldering machine. Run several cycles without carriage cover to verify smooth operation.

## HEATER AUTOTUNING

When a major change in heater (preheat or solder) set point is made (greater than 75°F) it may be necessary to re-tune the heaters to optimize their performance at the new set point. The Solder Pot Heater is tuned at the factory to 500°F and the Preheater to 700°F.

1. Change Recipe so the desired set point is displayed on the Main Menu Screen.

1. If the Preheater is being tuned, press the On button on the Main Menu Screen to turn on the Preheat Elements.

1. Press the Options button on the Main menu to bring up the Options Screen.

1. Press the Autotune Heaters button to bring up the Autotuning Screen.

1. Press the Start button for the heater you wish to tune. Only perform one autotuning function at a time. If you wish to tune both the Solder Heater and the Preheater, tune the Solder Pot Heater first, then tune the Preheater.

1. Once the On light on the Autotuning Screen goes off the procedure is finished and the machine is ready for operation at the new set point.

The autotuning procedure can take 1 - 2 hours when tuning the Solder Pot Heater. During this period the displayed solder temperature will not be accurate. If you wish to monitor the autotuning process, you will need to use a separate thermocouple.
