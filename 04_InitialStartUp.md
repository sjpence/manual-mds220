# INITIAL START-UP

## SET UP START POSITION

1. Remove the cover from the flux tank.

1. Turn the main power switch, located on the power module cover, to the ON position. The control module should power up and the following display should be visible on the touchscreen.

    > In order for the carriage to run, the START button on the touchscreen must be green. The START button will change from blue to green once the solder pot reaches the set temperature the first time after power has been turned on. The ABORT button on the touchscreen will always bring the carriage back to the home position regardless of the current solder pot temperature. The display on the main Menu screen should show the current solder pot temperature followed by 13 in the set-point temperature location. The solder pot temperature in recipe \#1 has been set for 13°F in order to keep the solder pot heater from turning on before the solder pot is charged with solder.

1. Press the red ABORT button on the touchscreen. The carriage will now move to the home position, which is at the extreme left end of the chrome rails. (The carriage may hit the flux tank if the tank is not centered between the rails, is too high, or if the cover has been left on.)

## CHARGE THE SOLDER POT

The solder pot holds about 150 lbs. (68 kg.) of solder, but only a fraction of that should be loaded at one time. We recommend high grade Sn63, 63% tin (Sn) and 37% lead (Pb), for all work. Place about 25 to 50 lbs. of solder bars into the pot, covering the bottom surface of the solder pot. Place them neatly and try to cover as much of the bottom surface as possible. CAUTION: DO NOT BUMP OR DENT THE THERMOCOUPLE WELL. This could cause an external leak or make the thermocouple difficult to remove.

![Initial Charging of Solder Pot](/media/image6.png)

1. Press the Recipe Setup Button on the touchscreen. Then press the “2” button to select Recipe \#2. After you select recipe \#2, press the Main Button to return to the Main Menu Screen. You should see that the set temperature for the solder pot has changed to 500°F. Also, the actual solder temperature should begin to rise.

1. It will take about 20-30 minutes for the initial solder charge to start melting. Once the solder in the solder pot has melted and the actual solder temperature has reached approximately 450°F, carefully add solder by sliding bars into the pot. Be careful not to splash hot solder and not to hit the thermocouple centered at the left end of the pot (see picture, section 1.5). Keep adding solder until the solder level is .075" to .100" from the top of the solder pot rim.

1. As the level gets closer to the rim of the solder pot, check to see if the solder is level in respect to the solder pot. Before the soldering or tinning machines leave the factory, the solder pot level and height are checked in relationship to the frame. If the solder is not level in the pot, most likely the frame is not level in one or both horizontal axes. Adjust the frame as necessary.

    > If the solder pot requires minor adjusting, extreme care should be exercised because of the danger of hot solder. Adjustment of the solder pot is done by turning the hexagonal bolt heads of the leveling screws located below the solder pot. If the solder pot is lowered too much, the boards may not reach the solder. BE SURE TO TIGHTEN THE LOCK NUTS AFTER ADJUSTMENT.

Once the solder pot is fully charged with solder (.075" - .100" from the top), you may confirm accurate solder level by performing the following test:

1. Take the PCB carrier and move the single finger bars to the maximum width possible by loosening the screws, sliding the bars outward, and then re-tightening. The fingers should be inclined inward. Place the PCB carrier on the carriage. You are now ready to run a test cycle through the system to confirm solder pot level.

1. Confirm that Recipe \#2 is selected by pressing the Recipe Setup Button on the Main Menu Screen. Check to see that the “2" button is green instead of blue. Then press the Main key to return.

    > Note: The machine will not operate if the START button is not green, signifying that the solder is at the correct temperature. Also if the carriage is not at its home position the cycle will not start.

1. Press the green START button. If the START button is green and the unit does not operate, simply lift the end of the carriage and push slightly forward, then press the red ABORT button. This should automatically bring the carriage to the start or home position. If the unit will still not cycle, please refer to the Troubleshooting Section of the manual.

1. During the solder immersion, set for 10.0 seconds in recipe \#2, observe the solder level in relation to the PCB carrier fingers. The solder level should be at the center of the “V” shaped, board gripping sections of the fingers in the corners of the carrier.

1. If the “V” sections don’t enter the solder, you need to add more solder. If they are not equally deep in the solder you need to re-level the system. Remember, the liquid solder is the ultimate level and you want to have it equidistant down from each pot edge. To re-level the machine, first level the frame, then the rails and finally level the solder pot. After re-leveling run the test again.

Now you should run a practice scrap PCB to make the final test. 

1. Leaving the carrier on the carriage at the loading (left) end, loosen the finger bars and move them towards the center. First tighten one bar, then place the PCB in the finger “V”s. Slide in the other bar and tighten. Finger pressure should not be excessive, just tight enough to hold the board securely. You should be able to get the board in and out of the fingers without loosening the finger bars. Excessive spring pressure may cause some boards to warp as they soften at the soldering temperature.

1. Now cycle the carriage by pressing the START button. During the solder immersion, check that the solder level is equal on all four sides of the PCB. If you are using a small PCB, we suggest using two or more boards spaced strategically to perform the test. The solder level should visually show about .030" PCB immersion.

The ALT-100/200 and MDS-210 have adjustable carriers and their level should be verified on a flat surface. Adjust the feet as necessary before running tests to check solder depth and if the machine is level.

If the machine level is still off, re-level the frame, rails and/or solder pot. Again, make sure the solder level is equal on all four sides of the solder pot to avoid the possibility of solder spillage at some future time.

## FILL AND ADJUST FOAM FLUX TANK (MDS-100/200)

Now that the solder is melted, the solder pot is leveled and the solder level is correct, you may fill and adjust the foam flux tank.

Remove the carrier from the carriage. Using a foaming type flux, fill the flux tank with 1½ - 1¾ gallons of flux. The flux level should be about one inch below the weld line on the foam funnel.

CAUTION:

BE SURE THAT THE EXTERNAL DRAIN HOSE IS ATTACHED TO THE HOSE CLIPS ON THE OUTSIDE WALL OF THE FLUXER TO AVOID SPILL.

1. Once the flux tank is full, be sure that the air hose is connected between the fluxer and the bulkhead fitting (as described in the installation section of this manual).

    ![Connection Point for Flux Tank](/media/image8.png)

1. Attach an air supply line to the fitting located next to the electrical box on the right rear panel of the machine.

    ![Air System Hook Up](/media/image9.png)

1. Turn the flux system regulator, the left of the two regulators located behind the left set of doors, completely counter-clockwise (off). On the Main Menu screen on the operator interface press the Options button. The display will change to the Options screen. Press the Flux Override button. This displays a screen that allows the flux system and air knife to be turned on manually to facilitate setup. Press the ON button for the flux system and the air solenoid will open allowing air to flow to the airstone.

    ![Flux System and Air Knife Pressure Regulators](/media/image10.png)

1. Slowly turn the flux system regulator clockwise until the gauge displays 10-15 psi.

    ![Flux Override Screen](/media/image11.png)

1. The flux should now be foaming. Note: Not all fluxes are alike. Some require a low air flow while others require high air flow. You should see at least a ½" foam height above the foam funnel. You may need to adjust the flux system regulator to achieve these conditions.

1. You are now ready to adjust and level the fluxer. Use the T-handled Allen wrench, included with the machine, to raise the foam fluxer. Raise the fluxer as high as possible while not restricting the leads beneath your boards. It may be helpful to place a board into the carrier. To check the flux level run cycles as described in section 4.2.

1. Once you are finished setting up the flux tank press the OFF button on the Flux Override Screen to shut off the foam fluxer.

## HIGH PRESSURE AIR KNIFE SETUP

The high pressure air knife flow is controlled using the right of the two regulators located behind the left set of doors in an MDS-100/200. In an MDS-210 there is only one pressure regulator behind the doors.

The regulator should be set at approximately 20-25 psi. The flow can be checked by going to the Flux Override screen as described in section 4.3 and pressing the ON button for the air-knife. The air knife may need to be adjusted, depending on the boards being run, in order to properly distribute the flux.

Also, the angle of the air knife may need to be adjusted in order to keep the air flow from interfering with the foam fluxer. This can be accomplished by loosening the set screw in the air knife mounting block found on the rear side of the chrome rails. The air knife can then be turned to its new orientation and the set screw tightened.
